# MERN Stack Learning Journey

Hi! I’m **Mohanasri S**, learning **MERN Stack Web Development**
(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and documenting my learning journey.

This repository is created to track my progress in full stack development
and to practice building real-time web applications using modern technologies.

## Objective

The main objective of learning the MERN stack is:

- To understand complete web application development
- To learn both frontend and backend technologies
- To build responsive and interactive user interfaces
- To develop secure and efficient server-side applications
- To connect applications with databases
- To gain practical knowledge through real-time projects

## Tech Stack Overview

### Frontend
- **React.js** is used to build user interfaces
- Helps in creating reusable components
- Provides fast and dynamic web page rendering

### Backend
- **Node.js** is used for server-side programming
- **Express.js** helps to build APIs easily
- Handles client requests and server responses

### Database
