      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a dedicated and highly motivated Full Stack Developer with a
        strong passion for building professional, scalable, and user-friendly
        web applications. I specialize in modern technologies including React,
        JavaScript, Node.js, and database systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey in software development started with a deep curiosity about
        how technology works. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a strong
        skill set in designing efficient systems, writing clean code, and
        developing responsive web applications that solve real-world problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in writing maintainable and scalable code while focusing on
        performance optimization and user experience. I enjoy working in team
        environments, collaborating with designers and developers to create
        impactful digital solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to contribute to a forward-thinking company where I can apply
        my technical skills, continuously learn new technologies, and help
        build innovative products that deliver value to users and businesses.
